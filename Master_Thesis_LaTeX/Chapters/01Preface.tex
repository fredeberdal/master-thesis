This thesis represents the end of my five year academic journey. It has been a challenging but extremely rewarding experience, one that has given me a solid foundation in software development. \\

The motivation for this research came from my interest in improving software quality and educational methods in teaching programming. Recognizing the importance of code reviews in educational programs as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and practical application, I aimed to explore how different code selection techniques could be optimized to improve the peer review process. \\

Throughout the ups and downs of writing this thesis, I have been fortunate to have had a dedicated supervisor who kept me on track and helped me stay afloat. Trond, I am grateful for your guidance, expertise, and encouragement throughout this journey. \\

I would also like to thank my family and friends for their unrelenting support and understanding during this period, I appreciate all you have done for me. Your encouragement has been a source of strength and motivation for me. \\
